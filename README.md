# Multiple Disease Prediction System with Machine Learning

Predict your risk of developing diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and heart disease with this easy-to-use web app.

This system uses machine learning to analyze your medical information and generate personalized predictions. Simply input your age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant factors, and our app will tell you how likely you are to develop each disease.

I also intend to provide visualizations and insights to help you understand your risk factors and take steps to improve your health.

Get started today and take control of your health!

To use this system:

Clone the repository and install the dependencies.
Download the pre-trained machine learning models.
Run the Streamlit app.
Input your medical information and click "Predict."
View the results and visualizations.
I hope this system helps you to stay healthy and informed.
